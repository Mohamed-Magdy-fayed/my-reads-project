# MyReads Project

This is the functional project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project at this state does every thing needed as in the rubric. 
The main and /search pages now work properly without any obvious bugs.

## TL;DR

To install the app and test it right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* use this [link](https://mohamed-magdy-fayed.github.io/my-reads-project/) to view the final build on github pages.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
